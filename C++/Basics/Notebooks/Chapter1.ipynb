    "In general programming, an expression is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a value. The process of executing an expression is called evaluation, and the resulting value produced is called the result of the expression (also sometimes called the return value).\n",

We haven’t covered function calls yet, but in the context of an expression, function calls evaluate to whatever value the function returns.\n",
    "\n",

Fortunately, it’s trivial to convert any expression into an equivalent statement. An expression statement is a statement that consists of an expression followed by a semicolon.
