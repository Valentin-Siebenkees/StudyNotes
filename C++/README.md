# C++

This folder contains my study notes and resources for learning **C++**.

While I had a basic introduction to C during my university studies, I’ve decided to revisit and deepen my understanding of C++, since it has been relevant in many of my work and master thesis projects.
For example when I have been confronted with time critical tasks which required a certain lvl of efficiancy like manipulating, transcoding and displaying a video signal on application runtime.

## Approach
I decided that the best way to learn and understand C++ in depth, is to revisit the basics and start from scratch.

I’m using **[LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)** as my primary resource for learning the basics of C++. My C++ notes are also organized in Jupyter Notebooks, which you can find in the **[Basics/Notebooks](Basics/Notebooks/)** folder.

You might wonder why someone would use jupyter notebooks for C++ code since that is counterintuitiv to the compile-run model nature of C++.
However since my goal is mainly to combine explanations and code snippets in my notes, doing this with C++ kernel in a jupyter notebook seemed like a fitting solution, especially since I used jupyter notebooks in most of my other learning topics, like Python, Machine Learning, Data Structures and algorithms etc. and this keeps the consistency in my documentation.

To enable C++ in Jupyter, I’m using **[xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling)**, a C++ kernel for Jupyter. This allows me to write and execute C++ code directly in the notebooks.

If you want to use this too I recommend reading the documentation which is provided under the given link above.

Furthermore if you´re like me on a windows system I recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) **[WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)** for the installation and usage.
