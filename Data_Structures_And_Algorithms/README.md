# Data Structures and Algorithms

This folder contains my study notes, implementations, and resources for learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The goal is to document key concepts, analyze their time and space complexity, and provide practical implementations.

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Topics Covered
Here’s a starting structure and some ideas, this might change in the future:

1. **[Big O](BigO/):** Understanding time and space complexity.
2. **[Data Structures](DataStructures/):** Implementing and analyzing common data structures.
3. **[Sorting Algorithms](SortingAlgorithms/):** Notes and implementations of sorting algorithms.
4. **[Searching Algorithms](SearchingAlgorithms/):** Notes and implementations of searching algorithms.
5. **[Advanced Algorithms](AdvancedAlgorithms/):** Exploring more complex algorithms like dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.
