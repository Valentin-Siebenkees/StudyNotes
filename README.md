# StudyNotes
Repository to organize my notes for different topics I want to learn or improve in, including:


* [Python](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/Python) – My go-to language for many tasks. I have a solid foundation but want to further improve and keep learning more advanced concepts.
  
* [C++](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/C%2B%2B) – A language I have some experience with, but I am now focusing on learning it in a more structured way, covering best practices and deeper language details.
  
* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/Machine_Learning) – I took courses during my Master’s degree, but I am revisiting core concepts and deepening my knowledge.
  
* [Medical Imaging](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/Medical_Imaging) – This directory includes different subtopics, e.g. concepts of medical imaging devices, how to apply machine learning on medical images, but also important medical standards
  
* [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/Data_Structures_And_Algorithms) – I wanted to learn DSA including BigO, Searching Algorithms, Sorting Algorithms and Advanced Algorithms
  
* [LeetCode](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/LeetCode) – Recently I started doing LeetCode Problems, to structure it I am mostly following the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
  
* [Optics](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/Optics) – A topic I wanted to revisit, including the physics of light and design of optical systems
  
* [Math](https://github.com/Valentin-Siebenkees/StudyNotes/tree/main/Math) – I also wanted to revisit some math concepts and go into detail when it comes to math concepts used in machine learning (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Linear Models & Optimization)
